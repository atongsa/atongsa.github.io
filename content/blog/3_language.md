---

## language choose universe
the universe behaves like quantumn <br>
all the pathways she go <br>
no choice <br>
the futrue will determine the past <br>
there is no causal, caus there is no time <br>

the language is the obeservor of the universe <br>
the wave of language sounds <br>
the universe then choose <br>
no wave no choose <br>

one day human died <br>
the languages dies <br>
cause there is no one let the language wave souds <br>
the universe died <br>

everything go on <br>
everything nothing <br>

i believe everyting nothing <br>
cause language believe the universe <br>
no language no universe <br>
